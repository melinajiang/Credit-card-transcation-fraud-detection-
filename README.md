# Credit-card-transcation-fraud-detection-
Credit card transaction fraud happens when someone makes an authorized transaction. One might suffer from credit card transaction fraud because his/her card got stolen, counterfeited or hacked. It can take two forms: card present or card non-present. For card present transaction fraud, the bank will pay for the loss; while for card not-present transaction fraud the merchant will pay for the loss. Thus, detecting transaction fraud can not only maintain customers’ cards using safety, but also help banks and companies save losses.

The purpose of this transaction fraud project is to look for anomalies among records of “card transactions” files by using a real time fraud algorithm (supervised models) normally applied to deal with transaction fraud. Our goal is to build and tune a model that has the highest FDR (fraud detection rate) when examining 3% of the record population. And we believe such a model will help find out the optimal division point to target suspicious transactions from a business perspective
